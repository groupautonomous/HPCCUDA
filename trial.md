<h3>Problem Description</h3>
Use posix threads to parallelize the given problem of finding the root of a given polynomial function .
By using newton's method iteratively for calculating the root to which a certain point in space converges.
By discritizing these points in the form of a matrix of given dimension with their extreme points having their real and imaginary part ranging from -2 and 2. Further use these values in creating a PPM image file for the time taken convergence of these roots and the root to which a certain point converges.

## Newton Method
