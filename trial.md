<h3>Problem Description</h3>
Use posix threads to parallelize the given problem of finding the root of a given polynomial function.
By using newton's method iteratively in the 


Use Newton's method to find the root of a given function for values ranging from -2-2i to 2+2i by discritizing the values in the form of a matrix of given dimension.
Further write these roots and the time taken for their convergence to a PPM file which inturn creates their respective image. Further use posix threads to parallelize the given problem and 
execute it within the given time limit.
